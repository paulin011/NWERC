\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}
\textbf{Description:} Finds shortest paths from a source to all vertices in weighted graphs with non-negative edges. Time: O((V+E) log V) with heap.

\begin{lstlisting}
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start, n):
    # Initialize distances to infinity
    dist = [float('inf')] * n
    dist[start] = 0
    
    # Min heap: (distance, node)
    heap = [(0, start)]
    
    while heap:
        d, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        # Skip if already processed with better distance
        if d > dist[node]:
            continue
        
        # Relax edges
        for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
            new_dist = dist[node] + weight
            
            if new_dist < dist[neighbor]:
                dist[neighbor] = new_dist
                heapq.heappush(heap, (new_dist, neighbor))

    dist = [float('inf')] * n
    parent = [-1] * n
    dist[start] = 0
    heap = [(0, start)]
    
    while heap:
